# DGUI - Derek's GUI Toolkit
**DGUI** is a beginner-friendly GUI toolkit that aims to be simple and easy-to-pickup without sacrificing flexibility or commonly held GUI programming paradigms (more details on our Philosophy is found in a separate file).

## Usage
*Under construction*

For now, see the examples in the [`examples`](src/com/jeromecompsci/dgui/examples) package. They are pretty self-explanatory.
